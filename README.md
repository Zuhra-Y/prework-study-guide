## Description


Often at times when learning something new, it can be extremely difficult to retain and use all the valuable information. I wanted a place to help new students to be able to keep all new information for reference, that they can add to and utilise.
I built this project to facilitate students with record keeping and having one place to accumulate all notes which can be added to,the more they learn.

It allows the retention of new information and omits the reality of losing infromation whether physically or figuratively. I know that I've been new to learning something; between my own notes, hard copies supplied by the establishment or soft copies ditributed, I've been left juggling various sources of information and I wanted to help with minimise this crucial problem.

In creating this project, I learnt how to use and the importance of being precise in using GitHub. It allowed me to exercise debugging; no code but issues between my branches in GitHub, the terminal and commiting the correct branches always. It has allowed me to further practice but instilled extra vigilance in my work. Sounds strange but I very much enjoyed the problems I encountered which were only sweeter when I figured out how to make this right. I also learnt what the developer role entails and putting this in action as it's something I've not done before. The role is far greater than just using VS Code and learning various languages/programs.

In creating this project, I'd love to add more notes in the respective sections as well a feature for users to test their knowledge by having a quiz or game. This would be a great addition to consolidate learning and seek opportunities for further reading, learning etc.
